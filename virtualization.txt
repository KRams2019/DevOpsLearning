- Technique of splitting of physical resource into as many as logical resources.
- Virtualization is technology that transform hardware into software.
- 1:N (1 server N VM's)

Advantage: High Availability, Fault tolerance, Reduced costs.

Hypervisor is piece of software or firmware that create and run virtual Machine.
A Hypervisor is somtimes also called a Virtual Machine Manager(VMM).

Type-1 Hypervisor::(Firmware)(Bare Metal/Native)
	->Also called Bare metal hypervisor and run directly on systems hardware.
	->Esxi provide virutalization layer that abstracts the cpu,storage and n/w resources of the 
	physical host into multiple vm.
        ->Hardware level Virtualization.
	->VMware Esxi,Hyper v

Type -2 Hypervisor::(Hosted Type)
	->Hypervisor that runs within a conventional OS enviroment, and the host os provided.
